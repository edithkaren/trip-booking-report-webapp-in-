Task Description â€“ Itinerary Builder PDF Generator

 I have  build a frontend itinerary builder that allows users to create a multi-day tour plan and generate a PDF output based on the provided Figma design template.
This webapp has some features like - 
Users cas  add or remove days from the itinerary.
For each day, users are able to  enter:
Activities / Sightseeing plans (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)
Flights, transfers, or transport details (if any)
Users should input hotel details (hotel name, check-in/check-out dates, number of nights, and city).
Tour overview details such as trip title, total duration, number of travelers, departure/arrival details, etc. has been  captured.
Payment plan input: user specifies number of installments, payment amounts, and due dates.
Inclusions and exclusions should also be user-input.
After all data is entered, the system  generates a downloadable PDF itinerary that matches the given design
